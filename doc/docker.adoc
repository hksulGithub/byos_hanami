= Docker

We provide {docker_link} support in case you don't want to use our {ruby_link} stack. Both a development and production environment is provided for you. In most cases, you'll want to use {docker_compose_link} to manage the stack. We also provide pre-built Docker link:https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami/pkgs/container/terminus[images] for AMD 64 and ARM 64.

== Setup

To get setup, run:

[source,]
----
git clone https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami terminus
cd terminus
bin/setup docker
----

== Configuration

You'll want to customize the environment variables in your `.env` file so your device can connect. This is automatically setup for you but, depending on your specific needs, you'll want to customize further. Specifically, to ensure the `API_URI` and `HANAMI_PORT` environment variables are set for your host. See link:/#configuration[Configuration] for details.

ðŸ’¡ When making environment variable changes (or the `.env` file in general), ensure you restart Docker (or Docker Compose) to apply the changes.

== Images

To use pre-built images, run either of the following:

[source,bash]
----
# Latest
docker pull ghcr.io/usetrmnl/terminus:latest

# Specific version.
docker pull ghcr.io/usetrmnl/terminus:<version>
----

== Compose

Use {docker_compose_link} to quickly launch the entire stack for development or production environments. You can also update `compose.dev.yml` or `compose.yml` to use the pre-built or local images as follows:

*Local Image Only*

[source,yaml]
----
build:
  context: .
----

*Pre-Built Image Only*

[source,yaml]
----
image: ghcr.io/usetrmnl/terminus:latest
----

Further details can be found in the `compose.yml` or `compose.dev.yml` files at the root of this project.

== Development

To develop with Docker, use the following scripts:

* `bin/docker/up`: Use to start up all services via Docker Compose.
* `bin/docker/down`: Use to shut down all services via Docker Compose.
* `bin/docker/compose`: Use to run any Docker Compose command.
** `web`: Pass this argument to rebuild the web service in order to pick up the local changes.
** `exec web bash`: This'll give you a Bash shell within root of the project. Use `bin/console` to launch a Hanami console.
** `docker logs terminus-web-1`: Use this to view the web service logs.
* `bin/docker/entrypoint-dev`: Used by `compose.dev.yml` to ensure the web service is setup properly.

If you only care about the web image, then you can use the `Dockerfile` via these scripts:

* `bin/docker/build`: This will build a new image based on latest changes to this project.
* `bin/docker/console`: This will immediately give you a console for which to explore you Docker image from the command line.

You can also run the image as a standalone instance. This does mean you've got more work to do but the command would look like this:

[source,bash]
----
docker run \
       --init \
       --rm \
       --env-file .env \
     --publish 2345:2345 \
       -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://$USER:@host.docker.internal:5432/terminus_production" \
       terminus
----

Here's the breakdown of what the above is doing:

- `run`: Allows you to run the Terminus image.
- `--init`: Ensures program signals are forwarded and processes are reaped (cleaned up) after terminating otherwise you could run out of memory from too many zombie processes.
- `--rm`: Ensures the container is automatically removed once you are done running Terminus.
- `--env-file`: Ensures your environment settings are properly picked up from the global `.env` file.
- `--publish`: Ensures the `DATABASE_URL` (and ports) are mapped for connection on your local network by using the special `host.docker.internal` host.

You might need to customize depending on how you've configured and setup PostgreSQL. Otherwise, using Docker Compose is the recommended route.

== Production

To launch the production stack, run:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

That's it!

== Troubleshooting

When using the _Quick Start_ or _Setup_ scripts, they will create a `.env` file which is picked up by Docker Compose. The two critical environment variables to pay attention to are:

* `API_URI`: This needs to be updated if your server IP address has changed or when the setup script failed to automatically detect your IP address. Your device also needs this URI in order to connect to your server. So both your server and device must be using the same URI.
* `PG_PASSWORD`: This is automatically generated for you but if you regenerate the `.env` file or change this value without updating your database, you'll lose access to your database. When access is lost, there are two ways to fix:
** Use PostgreSQL admin access to update to the password used in your `.env` file.
** Delete the associated database volume and then launch `docker-compose up` again. The volume can be identified as: `+terminus-*_database-data+`. You'll lose all of your data but will be able to setup your device again.
